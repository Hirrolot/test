Metalang99 is a foundation for writing reliable and maintainable metaprograms in pure C99. It is implemented as an interpreted FP language upon preprocessor macros; just `#include <metalang99.h>` and you are ready to go. Metalang99 features algebraic data types, pattern matching, recursion, currying, and collections; in addition, it provides a means for compile-time error reporting and debugging.
