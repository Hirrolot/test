Currently, Metalang99 is used at OpenIPC to develop real-time streaming software for IP cameras; this includes an RTSP 1.0 implementation along with ~50k lines of private code. However, we do not write macros by hand; we use existing fine-grained libraries that are built upon Metalang99: Datatype99 and Interface99.
